# DAL EVENTS WEBSITE

This is a website for my family's event venue business. It is a Next.js app that connects to a firebase server.

## GOALS

1. Create a nice looking UI for people to see and also showcase how the event hall looks.
2. Create a way for customers to book the event hall on certain dates.
3. Create firebase cloud functions that send emails to the user and the admins of the bookings. These bookings are also stored in Cloud Firestore.
4. Create an admin panel so that admins can sort out the bookings and accept, reschedule or decline bookings on certain dates.

## GETTING STARTED

1. Clone the repository using **git clone**
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run **npm install** to install the needed dependencies

### FOR DEVELOPMENT

4. Run **npm run dev** to run a development server.

### FOR PRODUCTION

5. Run **npm run build** to build the production version project.
6. Then run **npm start** to start running the production build server
